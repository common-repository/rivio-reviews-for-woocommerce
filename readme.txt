Having customer reviews is proven to drive traffic and boost webshop sales by over 10%. They are what 9 out of 10 people look for at first when they find a product they like. But these can be a hassle to collect. More than ever, customers rely on the opinions of others to help them make purchase decisions. Reviews help potential customers feel that they know what they’re getting. They feel that this first hand information is honest, accurate and therefore very useful to them. Reviews build trust and confidence.

Before RIVIO, it took a lot of time to build your product review section and create traction and community around your brand. For new businesses, or businesses that simply haven’t been in the digital space earlier, lack of such a tool can already mean serious disadvantage in sales and profit to companies who have a more competitive price with relevant customer reviews to back it up.

RIVIO is a full service review solution that is built with a special AI based tool, the RIVIO FusionFilter, that allows webshops from all over the world to share real product reviews. This means that any reviews written by other webshop's customers about any product you’re selling can immediately be displayed after installation on your site as your own. This unique review aggregation feature is a powerful tool for all those who understand the importance and want much more reviews on their shops. RIVIO optimizes review generation costs and efforts and maximizes traffic and sales to your e-commerce site.
